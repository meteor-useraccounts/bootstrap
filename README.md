# useraccounts:bootstrap

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for twitter Bootstrap

This package depends on [useraccounts:core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core)

Learn more [here](http://useraccounts.meteor.com) or have a look at a [live demo application](http://useraccounts-bootstrap.meteor.com) or at the full [documentation](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core).


## Bring Your Own Bootstrap

Adding this package with `meteor add useraccounts:bootstrap` does not add any other packages providing Bootstrap. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!

[nemo64:bootstrap](https://atmospherejs.com/nemo64/bootstrap) integrates bootstrap into Meteor and lets you configure what parts you need.

At the moment it is up to date with Bootstrap 3.3.0.
